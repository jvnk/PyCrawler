PyCrawler is very simple to use. It takes (up to) 6 arguments:

1) database file name: The file that that will be used to store information as a sqlite database. If the filename given does not exist, it will be created.

2) start url: Crawlers need a place to start! This should be a valid url.
   ex. http://www.mysite.com/

3) crawl depth: This should be the number of pages deep the crawler should follow from the starting url before backing out.

4) follow offsite links (true/false): self explanatory. true by default.

5) verbose (true/false): If you want PyCrawler to spit out the urls it is looking at, this should be "true" if it is missing, or has any other value, it will be ignored and considered false.

6) strip html (true/false): strips any tags in raw html matching "<*>". Places raw content into "content" table with pagetitle, url and content blob
